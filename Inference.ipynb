rapid, involuntary eye movements (nystagmus); or degeneration of the nerves that carry information from the eyes to the brain (optic atrophy). severe breathing problems are common in people with leigh syndrome, and these problems can worsen until they cause acute respiratory failure. some affected individuals develop hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is a thickening of the heart muscle that forces the heart to work harder to pump blood. in addition, a substance called lactate can build up in the body, and excessive amounts are often found in the blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or urine of people with leigh syndrome.  the signs and symptoms of leigh syndrome are caused in part by patches of damaged tissue (lesions) that develop in the brains of people with this condition. a procedure called magnetic resonance imaging (mri) reveals characteristic lesions in certain regions of the brain and the brainstem (the part of the brain that is connected to the spinal cord). these regions include the basal ganglia, which help control movement;

rapid, involuntary eye movements (nystagmus); or degeneration of the nerves that carry information from the eyes to the brain (optic atrophy). severe breathing problems are common in people with leigh syndrome, and these problems can worsen until they cause acute respiratory failure. some affected individuals develop hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is a thickening of the heart muscle that forces the heart to work harder to pump blood. in addition, a substance called lactate can build up in the body, and excessive amounts are often found in the blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or urine of people with leigh syndrome.  the signs and symptoms of leigh syndrome are caused in part by patches of damaged tissue (lesions) that develop in the brains of people with this condition. a procedure called magnetic resonance imaging (mri) reveals characteristic lesions in certain regions of the brain and the brainstem (the part of the brain that is connected to the spinal cord). these regions include the basal ganglia, which help control movement; the cerebellum, which controls the ability to balance and coordinates movement; and the brainstem, which controls functions such as swallowing, breathing, hearing, and seeing. the brain lesions are often accompanied by loss of the myelin coating around nerves (demyelination), which reduces the ability of the nerves to activate muscles used for movement or relay sensory information back to the brain.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"intent_code\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 6,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 19,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 16,\n        \"samples\": [\n          3,\n          9,\n          19\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"intent\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 16,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"desc\",\n          \"information\",\n          \"treatment\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"context\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 89,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"## How many people are affected by Shwachman-Diamond syndrome ?\\nResearchers are not sure how common Shwachman-Diamond syndrome is.

Estimates range from 1 in 250 to 1 in 5,000 children. Three to four times as many males are affected than females.  Because of changes in the way developmental disorders are classified, Asperger syndrome was not often diagnosed in adults until recently, and the prevalence is often perceived to be rising as more people are recognized to have features of the condition.

The wider end of the pancreas is called the head, the middle section is called the body, and the narrow end is called the tail. The pancreas lies behind the stomach and in front of the spine.      There are two kinds of cells in the pancreas:         -   Endocrine pancreas cells  make several kinds of hormones (chemicals that control the actions of certain cells or organs in the body), such as insulin to control blood sugar. They cluster together in many small groups (islets) throughout the pancreas. Endocrine pancreas cells are also called islet cells or islets of Langerhans. Tumors that form in islet cells are called islet cell tumors, pancreatic endocrine tumors, or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pancreatic NETs).     -   Exocrine pancreas cells  make enzymes that are released into the small intestine to help the body digest food. Most of the pancreas is made of ducts with small sacs at the end of the ducts, which are lined with exocrine cells.         This summary discusses islet cell tumors of the endocrine pancreas. See the PDQ summary on Pancreatic Cancer Treatment for information on exocrine pancreatic cancer.    Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) may be benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer). When pancreatic NETs are malignant, they are called pancreatic endocrine cancer or islet cell carcinoma.   Pancreatic NETs are much less common than pancreatic exocrine tumors and have a better prognosis.  \\nThere are different kinds of functional pancreatic NETs.Thelong-termcomplicationsofdiabetesaresimilarinalltypesandaffectmainlybloodvessels,andthekidneys,nerves,andeyes.Thedevelopmentofthesecomplicationsisattributedtothreeunderlyingmechanisms:formationofAGEs,activationofPKC,anddisturbancesinpolyolpathwaysleadingtooxidativestress. http://ebooksmedicine.net\\n\\nPancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs), also known as islet cell tumors, are rare in comparison with tumors of the exocrine pancreas, accounting for only 2% of all pancreatic neoplasms. PanNETs are most common in adults and may be single or multifocal; when they are malignant, the liver is the most common site of metastases. These tumors have a propensity to elaborate pancreatic hormones, but some are nonfunctional. The latter typically are larger at the time of diagnosis, since they come to clinical attention later in their natural history than functional PanNETs, which often present with symptoms related to excessive hormone production. All PanNETs, with the exception of insulinomas (see later), are regarded as having malignant potential, and in fact, 60% to 90% of PanNETs manifest with overtly malignant features of biologic aggressiveness, such as invasion into local tissues or distant metastases. The tumors frequently have mutations in tumor suppressor genes MEN1 and PTEN, or inactivating mutations in genes (e.g. ATRX) whose products maintain telomere length. Beta cell tumors (insulinomas) are the most common type of PanNET and elaborate sufficient insulin to induce attacks of hypoglycemia when blood glucose levels fall below 50 mg/dL. These attacks manifest as confusion, stupor, and loss of consciousness. They are precipitated by fasting or exercise and are promptly relieved by feeding or parenteral administration of glucose. Most insulinomas are cured by surgical resection.

The tumors historically are divided into GI-NETs (in the GI tract) (also frequently called carcinoid tumors) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs), although newer pathologic classifications have proposed that they all be classified as GI-NETs. The term GI-NET has been proposed to replace the term carcinoid; however, the term carcinoid is widely used, and many are not familiar with this change.\",\n          \"# Chromosome 8q deletion  \\n## What is (are) Chromosome 8q deletion ?\\nChromosome 8q deletion is a chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is a missing copy of the genetic material located on the long arm (q) of chromosome 8. The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the deletion and which genes are involved. Features that often occur in people with chromosome 8q deletion include developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral problems, and distinctive facial features. Most cases are not inherited, but people can pass the deletion on to their children. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.## What are the genetic changes related to 22q13.3 deletion syndrome ?\\n22q13.3 deletion syndrome is caused by a deletion near the end of the long (q) arm of chromosome 22. The signs and symptoms of 22q13.3 deletion syndrome are probably related to the loss of multiple genes in this region. The size of the deletion varies among affected individuals.  A ring chromosome 22 can also cause 22q13.3 deletion syndrome. A ring chromosome is a circular structure that occurs when a chromosome breaks in two places, the tips of the chromosome are lost, and the broken ends fuse together. People with ring chromosome 22 have one copy of this abnormal chromosome in some or all of their cells. Researchers believe that several critical genes near the end of the long (q) arm of chromosome 22 are lost when the ring chromosome 22 forms. If one of the chromosome break points is at position 22q13.3, people with ring chromosome 22 have similar signs and symptoms as those with a simple deletion.  Researchers are working to identify all of the genes that contribute to the features of 22q13.3 deletion syndrome. They have determined that the loss of a particular gene on chromosome 22, SHANK3, is likely to be responsible for many of the syndrome's characteristic signs (such as developmental delay, intellectual disability, and impaired speech). Additional genes in the deleted region probably contribute to the varied features of 22q13.3 deletion syndrome.## What are the genetic changes related to 18q deletion syndrome ?\\n18q deletion syndrome is caused by a deletion of genetic material from the long (q) arm of chromosome 18. This chromosomal change is written as 18q-. The size of the deletion and its location on the chromosome vary among affected individuals.  The signs and symptoms of 18q deletion syndrome, including the leukodystrophy that likely contributes to the neurological problems, are probably related to the loss of multiple genes on the long arm of chromosome 18. 18q deletion syndrome is often categorized into two types: individuals with deletions near the end of the long arm of chromosome 18 are said to have distal 18q deletion syndrome, and those with deletions in the part of the long arm near the center of chromosome 18 are said to have proximal 18q deletion syndrome. The signs and symptoms of these two types of the condition are overlapping, with certain features being more common in one form of the disorder than in the other. For example, hearing loss and heart abnormalities are more common in people with distal 18q deletion syndrome, while seizures occur more often in people with proximal 18q deletion syndrome.

rapid, involuntary eye movements (nystagmus); or degeneration of the nerves that carry information from the eyes to the brain (optic atrophy). severe breathing problems are common in people with leigh syndrome, and these problems can worsen until they cause acute respiratory failure. some affected individuals develop hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is a thickening of the heart muscle that forces the heart to work harder to pump blood. in addition, a substance called lactate can build up in the body, and excessive amounts are often found in the blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or urine of people with leigh syndrome.  the signs and symptoms of leigh syndrome are caused in part by patches of damaged tissue (lesions) that develop in the brains of people with this condition. a procedure called magnetic resonance imaging (mri) reveals characteristic lesions in certain regions of the brain and the brainstem (the part of the brain that is connected to the spinal cord). these regions include the basal ganglia, which help control movement; the cerebellum, which controls the ability to balance and coordinates movement; and the brainstem, which controls functions such as swallowing, breathing, hearing, and seeing. the brain lesions are often accompanied by loss of the myelin coating around nerves (demyelination), which reduces the ability of the nerves to activate muscles used for movement or relay sensory information back to the brain.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"intent_code\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 6,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 19,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 16,\n        \"samples\": [\n          3,\n          9,\n          19\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"intent\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 16,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"desc\",\n          \"information\",\n          \"treatment\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"context\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 94,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"## What are the treatments for prekallikrein deficiency ?\\nThese resources address the diagnosis or management of prekallikrein deficiency:  - Genetic Testing Registry: Prekallikrein deficiency  - Massachusetts General Hospital Laboratory Handbook: Prekallikrein   These resources from MedlinePlus offer information about the diagnosis and management of various health conditions:  - Diagnostic Tests  - Drug Therapy  - Surgery and Rehabilitation  - Genetic Counseling   - Palliative Care## How many people are affected by prekallikrein deficiency ?\\nThe prevalence of prekallikrein deficiency is unknown. Approximately 80 affected individuals in about 30 families have been described in the medical literature. Because prekallikrein deficiency usually does not cause any symptoms, researchers suspect that most people with the condition are never diagnosed.# prekallikrein deficiency  \\n## What is (are) prekallikrein deficiency ?\\nPrekallikrein deficiency is a blood condition that usually causes no health problems. In people with this condition, blood tests show a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT), a result that is typically associated with bleeding problems; however, bleeding problems generally do not occur in prekallikrein deficiency. The condition is usually discovered when blood tests are done for other reasons.  A few people with prekallikrein deficiency have experienced health problems related to blood clotting such as heart attack, stroke, a clot in the deep veins of the arms or legs (deep vein thrombosis), nosebleeds, or excessive bleeding after surgery. However, these are common problems in the general population, and most affected individuals have other risk factors for developing them, so it is unclear whether their occurrence is related to prekallikrein deficiency.\",\n          \"# What I need to know about My Child's Urinary Tract Infection  \\n## What is (are) What I need to know about My Child's Urinary Tract Infection ?\\nA UTI is an infection in the urinary tract. Infections are caused by microbesorganisms too small to be seen without a microscope. Bacteria * are the most common cause of UTIs. Normally, bacteria that enter the urinary tract are quickly removed by the body before they cause symptoms. But sometimes bacteria overcome the bodys natural defenses and cause infection.  \\n*See the Pronunciation Guide for tips on how to say the underlined words.## How to diagnose What I need to know about My Child's Urinary Tract Infection ?\\nTalk with your childs health care provider after your childs UTI is gone. The health care provider may want to do more tests to check for VUR or a blockage in the urinary tract. Repeated infections in an abnormal urinary tract may cause kidney damage. The kinds of tests ordered will depend on the child and the type of infection. VUR and blockages in the urinary tract often go away as a child grows. In some cases, surgery may be needed to correct any defects in the urinary tract. More information about tests for VUR or a blockage in the urinary tract is provided in the NIDDK health topic, Urinary Tract Infections in Children.## What is (are) Kidney Disease ?\\nWhen you visit your doctor, here are questions to ask about your kidneys. - What is my GFR?   - What is my urine albumin result?   - What is my blood pressure?   - What is my blood glucose (for people with diabetes)?

rapid, involuntary eye movements (nystagmus); or degeneration of the nerves that carry information from the eyes to the brain (optic atrophy). severe breathing problems are common in people with leigh syndrome, and these problems can worsen until they cause acute respiratory failure. some affected individuals develop hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is a thickening of the heart muscle that forces the heart to work harder to pump blood. in addition, a substance called lactate can build up in the body, and excessive amounts are often found in the blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or urine of people with leigh syndrome.  the signs and symptoms of leigh syndrome are caused in part by patches of damaged tissue (lesions) that develop in the brains of people with this condition. a procedure called magnetic resonance imaging (mri) reveals characteristic lesions in certain regions of the brain and the brainstem (the part of the brain that is connected to the spinal cord). these regions include the basal ganglia, which help control movement; the cerebellum, which controls the ability to balance and coordinates movement; and the brainstem, which controls functions such as swallowing, breathing, hearing, and seeing. the brain lesions are often accompanied by loss of the myelin coating around nerves (demyelination), which reduces the ability of the nerves to activate muscles used for movement or relay sensory information back to the brain.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"intent_code\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 6,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 19,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 16,\n        \"samples\": [\n          3,\n          9,\n          19\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"intent\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 16,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"desc\",\n          \"information\",\n          \"treatment\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"context\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 89,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"## How many people are affected by Shwachman-Diamond syndrome ?\\nResearchers are not sure how common Shwachman-Diamond syndrome is.

Estimates range from 1 in 250 to 1 in 5,000 children. Three to four times as many males are affected than females.  Because of changes in the way developmental disorders are classified, Asperger syndrome was not often diagnosed in adults until recently, and the prevalence is often perceived to be rising as more people are recognized to have features of the condition. Many mildly affected individuals likely continue to be undiagnosed.## How many people are affected by Aarskog-Scott syndrome ?\\nAarskog-Scott syndrome is believed to be a rare disorder; however, its prevalence is unknown because mildly affected people are often not diagnosed.\",\n          \"The pancreas is a gland about 6 inches long that is shaped like a thin pear lying on its side. The wider end of the pancreas is called the head, the middle section is called the body, and the narrow end is called the tail. The pancreas lies behind the stomach and in front of the spine.      There are two kinds of cells in the pancreas:         -   Endocrine pancreas cells  make several kinds of hormones (chemicals that control the actions of certain cells or organs in the body), such as insulin to control blood sugar. They cluster together in many small groups (islets) throughout the pancreas. Endocrine pancreas cells are also called islet cells or islets of Langerhans. Tumors that form in islet cells are called islet cell tumors, pancreatic endocrine tumors, or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pancreatic NETs).     -   Exocrine pancreas cells  make enzymes that are released into the small intestine to help the body digest food. Most of the pancreas is made of ducts with small sacs at the end of the ducts, which are lined with exocrine cells.         This summary discusses islet cell tumors of the endocrine pancreas. See the PDQ summary on Pancreatic Cancer Treatment for information on exocrine pancreatic cancer.    Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) may be benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer). When pancreatic NETs are malignant, they are called pancreatic endocrine cancer or islet cell carcinoma.   Pancreatic NETs are much less common than pancreatic exocrine tumors and have a better prognosis.  \\nThere are different kinds of functional pancreatic NETs.Thelong-termcomplicationsofdiabetesaresimilarinalltypesandaffectmainlybloodvessels,andthekidneys,nerves,andeyes.Thedevelopmentofthesecomplicationsisattributedtothreeunderlyingmechanisms:formationofAGEs,activationofPKC,anddisturbancesinpolyolpathwaysleadingtooxidativestress. http://ebooksmedicine.net\\n\\nPancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs), also known as islet cell tumors, are rare in comparison with tumors of the exocrine pancreas, accounting for only 2% of all pancreatic neoplasms. PanNETs are most common in adults and may be single or multifocal; when they are malignant, the liver is the most common site of metastases. These tumors have a propensity to elaborate pancreatic hormones, but some are nonfunctional. The latter typically are larger at the time of diagnosis, since they come to clinical attention later in their natural history than functional PanNETs, which often present with symptoms related to excessive hormone production. All PanNETs, with the exception of insulinomas (see later), are regarded as having malignant potential, and in fact, 60% to 90% of PanNETs manifest with overtly malignant features of biologic aggressiveness, such as invasion into local tissues or distant metastases. The tumors frequently have mutations in tumor suppressor genes MEN1 and PTEN, or inactivating mutations in genes (e.g. ATRX) whose products maintain telomere length. Beta cell tumors (insulinomas) are the most common type of PanNET and elaborate sufficient insulin to induce attacks of hypoglycemia when blood glucose levels fall below 50 mg/dL. These attacks manifest as confusion, stupor, and loss of consciousness. They are precipitated by fasting or exercise and are promptly relieved by feeding or parenteral administration of glucose. Most insulinomas are cured by surgical resection.

Gemcitabine was the standard\\n\\nGastrointestinal (GI) neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are tumors derived from the diffuse neuroendocrine system of the GI tract; that system is composed of amineand acid-producing cells with different hormonal profiles, depending on the site of origin. The tumors historically are divided into GI-NETs (in the GI tract) (also frequently called carcinoid tumors) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs), although newer pathologic classifications have proposed that they all be classified as GI-NETs. The term GI-NET has been proposed to replace the term carcinoid; however, the term carcinoid is widely used, and many are not familiar with this change.\",\n          \"# Chromosome 8q deletion  \\n## What is (are) Chromosome 8q deletion ?\\nChromosome 8q deletion is a chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is a missing copy of the genetic material located on the long arm (q) of chromosome 8. The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the deletion and which genes are involved. Features that often occur in people with chromosome 8q deletion include developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral problems, and distinctive facial features. Most cases are not inherited, but people can pass the deletion on to their children. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.## What are the genetic changes related to 22q13.3 deletion syndrome ?\\n22q13.3 deletion syndrome is caused by a deletion near the end of the long (q) arm of chromosome 22. The signs and symptoms of 22q13.3 deletion syndrome are probably related to the loss of multiple genes in this region. The size of the deletion varies among affected individuals.  A ring chromosome 22 can also cause 22q13.3 deletion syndrome. A ring chromosome is a circular structure that occurs when a chromosome breaks in two places, the tips of the chromosome are lost, and the broken ends fuse together. People with ring chromosome 22 have one copy of this abnormal chromosome in some or all of their cells. Researchers believe that several critical genes near the end of the long (q) arm of chromosome 22 are lost when the ring chromosome 22 forms. If one of the chromosome break points is at position 22q13.3, people with ring chromosome 22 have similar signs and symptoms as those with a simple deletion.  Researchers are working to identify all of the genes that contribute to the features of 22q13.3 deletion syndrome. They have determined that the loss of a particular gene on chromosome 22, SHANK3, is likely to be responsible for many of the syndrome's characteristic signs (such as developmental delay, intellectual disability, and impaired speech). Additional genes in the deleted region probably contribute to the varied features of 22q13.3 deletion syndrome.## What are the genetic changes related to 18q deletion syndrome ?\\n18q deletion syndrome is caused by a deletion of genetic material from the long (q) arm of chromosome 18. This chromosomal change is written as 18q-. The size of the deletion and its location on the chromosome vary among affected individuals.  The signs and symptoms of 18q deletion syndrome, including the leukodystrophy that likely contributes to the neurological problems, are probably related to the loss of multiple genes on the long arm of chromosome 18. 18q deletion syndrome is often categorized into two types: individuals with deletions near the end of the long arm of chromosome 18 are said to have distal 18q deletion syndrome, and those with deletions in the part of the long arm near the center of chromosome 18 are said to have proximal 18q deletion syndrome. The signs and symptoms of these two types of the condition are overlapping, with certain features being more common in one form of the disorder than in the other. For example, hearing loss and heart abnormalities are more common in people with distal 18q deletion syndrome, while seizures occur more often in people with proximal 18q deletion syndrome. Researchers are working to determine how the loss of specific genes in these regions contributes to the various features of 18q deletion syndrome.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"generated_answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 98,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"the document does not provide specific information about the genetic changes related to emanuel syndrome.\",\n          \"the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds) and other institutes of the national institutes of health (nih) support research related to paroxysmal hemicrania through grants to major medical institutions across the country. much of this research focuses on finding better ways to prevent, treat, and ultimately cure headache disorders such as paroxysmal hemicrania.\",\n          \"leigh syndrome is a group of rare, progressive neurodegenerative disorders that primarily affect the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":59}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from tqdm import tqdm\n","\n","final_answers = []\n","\n","for index, row in tqdm(df_test_sample_100.iterrows()):\n","    question = row['question']\n","    context = row['context']\n","    intent = row['intent']\n","    if intent == 'dont answer':\n","        answer = 'Sorry, this question cannot be answered with this system.'\n","    else:\n","        answer = generate_with_context(question, context)\n","    final_answers.append(answer.lower())\n","    print(answer)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"fBf_aiiJNev6","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1733976437727,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":194287,"user":{"displayName":"Hanif Muhammad Zhafran","userId":"14907620785076745865"}},"outputId":"76a8c8be-9de9-4e6b-ac0a-ffb27268a984"},"execution_count":60,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["1it [00:01,  1.50s/it]"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Dystonia is a group of movement problems characterized by involuntary, sustained muscle contractions, tremors, and other uncontrolled movements.\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["\r2it [00:03,  1.56s/it]"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Perineal injury in males is an injury to the perineum, the area between the anus and the scrotum, or sex organs.\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["\r3it [00:04,  1.49s/it]"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Doctors diagnose childhood interstitial lung disease (chILD) based on a child's medical and family histories and the results from tests and procedures.\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["\r4it [00:05,  1.17s/it]"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["The document does not contain information about Mondor disease.\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["\r5it [00:10,  2.62s/it]"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["The long-term outlook for a child with kidney dysplasia in both kidneys is different from the long-term outlook for a child with one dysplastic kidney.

rapid, involuntary eye movements (nystagmus); or degeneration of the nerves that carry information from the eyes to the brain (optic atrophy). severe breathing problems are common in people with leigh syndrome, and these problems can worsen until they cause acute respiratory failure. some affected individuals develop hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is a thickening of the heart muscle that forces the heart to work harder to pump blood. in addition, a substance called lactate can build up in the body, and excessive amounts are often found in the blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or urine of people with leigh syndrome.  the signs and symptoms of leigh syndrome are caused in part by patches of damaged tissue (lesions) that develop in the brains of people with this condition. a procedure called magnetic resonance imaging (mri) reveals characteristic lesions in certain regions of the brain and the brainstem (the part of the brain that is connected to the spinal cord). these regions include the basal ganglia, which help control movement; the cerebellum, which controls the ability to balance and coordinates movement; and the brainstem, which controls functions such as swallowing, breathing, hearing, and seeing. the brain lesions are often accompanied by loss of the myelin coating around nerves (demyelination), which reduces the ability of the nerves to activate muscles used for movement or relay sensory information back to the brain.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"intent_code\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 6,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 19,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 16,\n        \"samples\": [\n          3,\n          9,\n          19\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"intent\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 16,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"desc\",\n          \"information\",\n          \"treatment\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"context\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 89,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"## How many people are affected by Shwachman-Diamond syndrome ?\\nResearchers are not sure how common Shwachman-Diamond syndrome is.

Estimates range from 1 in 250 to 1 in 5,000 children. Three to four times as many males are affected than females.  Because of changes in the way developmental disorders are classified, Asperger syndrome was not often diagnosed in adults until recently, and the prevalence is often perceived to be rising as more people are recognized to have features of the condition. Many mildly affected individuals likely continue to be undiagnosed.## How many people are affected by Aarskog-Scott syndrome ?\\nAarskog-Scott syndrome is believed to be a rare disorder; however, its prevalence is unknown because mildly affected people are often not diagnosed.\",\n          \"The pancreas is a gland about 6 inches long that is shaped like a thin pear lying on its side. The wider end of the pancreas is called the head, the middle section is called the body, and the narrow end is called the tail. The pancreas lies behind the stomach and in front of the spine.      There are two kinds of cells in the pancreas:         -   Endocrine pancreas cells  make several kinds of hormones (chemicals that control the actions of certain cells or organs in the body), such as insulin to control blood sugar. They cluster together in many small groups (islets) throughout the pancreas. Endocrine pancreas cells are also called islet cells or islets of Langerhans. Tumors that form in islet cells are called islet cell tumors, pancreatic endocrine tumors, or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pancreatic NETs).     -   Exocrine pancreas cells  make enzymes that are released into the small intestine to help the body digest food. Most of the pancreas is made of ducts with small sacs at the end of the ducts, which are lined with exocrine cells.         This summary discusses islet cell tumors of the endocrine pancreas. See the PDQ summary on Pancreatic Cancer Treatment for information on exocrine pancreatic cancer.    Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) may be benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer). When pancreatic NETs are malignant, they are called pancreatic endocrine cancer or islet cell carcinoma.   Pancreatic NETs are much less common than pancreatic exocrine tumors and have a better prognosis.  \\nThere are different kinds of functional pancreatic NETs.Thelong-termcomplicationsofdiabetesaresimilarinalltypesandaffectmainlybloodvessels,andthekidneys,nerves,andeyes.Thedevelopmentofthesecomplicationsisattributedtothreeunderlyingmechanisms:formationofAGEs,activationofPKC,anddisturbancesinpolyolpathwaysleadingtooxidativestress. http://ebooksmedicine.net\\n\\nPancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs), also known as islet cell tumors, are rare in comparison with tumors of the exocrine pancreas, accounting for only 2% of all pancreatic neoplasms. PanNETs are most common in adults and may be single or multifocal; when they are malignant, the liver is the most common site of metastases. These tumors have a propensity to elaborate pancreatic hormones, but some are nonfunctional. The latter typically are larger at the time of diagnosis, since they come to clinical attention later in their natural history than functional PanNETs, which often present with symptoms related to excessive hormone production. All PanNETs, with the exception of insulinomas (see later), are regarded as having malignant potential, and in fact, 60% to 90% of PanNETs manifest with overtly malignant features of biologic aggressiveness, such as invasion into local tissues or distant metastases. The tumors frequently have mutations in tumor suppressor genes MEN1 and PTEN, or inactivating mutations in genes (e.g. ATRX) whose products maintain telomere length. Beta cell tumors (insulinomas) are the most common type of PanNET and elaborate sufficient insulin to induce attacks of hypoglycemia when blood glucose levels fall below 50 mg/dL. These attacks manifest as confusion, stupor, and loss of consciousness. They are precipitated by fasting or exercise and are promptly relieved by feeding or parenteral administration of glucose. Most insulinomas are cured by surgical resection.

The tumors historically are divided into GI-NETs (in the GI tract) (also frequently called carcinoid tumors) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs), although newer pathologic classifications have proposed that they all be classified as GI-NETs. The term GI-NET has been proposed to replace the term carcinoid; however, the term carcinoid is widely used, and many are not familiar with this change.\",\n          \"# Chromosome 8q deletion  \\n## What is (are) Chromosome 8q deletion ?\\nChromosome 8q deletion is a chromosome abnormality that occurs when there is a missing copy of the genetic material located on the long arm (q) of chromosome 8. The severity of the condition and the signs and symptoms depend on the size and location of the deletion and which genes are involved. Features that often occur in people with chromosome 8q deletion include developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral problems, and distinctive facial features. Most cases are not inherited, but people can pass the deletion on to their children. Treatment is based on the signs and symptoms present in each person.## What are the genetic changes related to 22q13.3 deletion syndrome ?\\n22q13.3 deletion syndrome is caused by a deletion near the end of the long (q) arm of chromosome 22. The signs and symptoms of 22q13.3 deletion syndrome are probably related to the loss of multiple genes in this region. The size of the deletion varies among affected individuals.  A ring chromosome 22 can also cause 22q13.3 deletion syndrome. A ring chromosome is a circular structure that occurs when a chromosome breaks in two places, the tips of the chromosome are lost, and the broken ends fuse together. People with ring chromosome 22 have one copy of this abnormal chromosome in some or all of their cells. Researchers believe that several critical genes near the end of the long (q) arm of chromosome 22 are lost when the ring chromosome 22 forms. If one of the chromosome break points is at position 22q13.3, people with ring chromosome 22 have similar signs and symptoms as those with a simple deletion.  Researchers are working to identify all of the genes that contribute to the features of 22q13.3 deletion syndrome. They have determined that the loss of a particular gene on chromosome 22, SHANK3, is likely to be responsible for many of the syndrome's characteristic signs (such as developmental delay, intellectual disability, and impaired speech). Additional genes in the deleted region probably contribute to the varied features of 22q13.3 deletion syndrome.## What are the genetic changes related to 18q deletion syndrome ?\\n18q deletion syndrome is caused by a deletion of genetic material from the long (q) arm of chromosome 18. This chromosomal change is written as 18q-. The size of the deletion and its location on the chromosome vary among affected individuals.  The signs and symptoms of 18q deletion syndrome, including the leukodystrophy that likely contributes to the neurological problems, are probably related to the loss of multiple genes on the long arm of chromosome 18. 18q deletion syndrome is often categorized into two types: individuals with deletions near the end of the long arm of chromosome 18 are said to have distal 18q deletion syndrome, and those with deletions in the part of the long arm near the center of chromosome 18 are said to have proximal 18q deletion syndrome. The signs and symptoms of these two types of the condition are overlapping, with certain features being more common in one form of the disorder than in the other. For example, hearing loss and heart abnormalities are more common in people with distal 18q deletion syndrome, while seizures occur more often in people with proximal 18q deletion syndrome. Researchers are working to determine how the loss of specific genes in these regions contributes to the various features of 18q deletion syndrome.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n
